                "In the fortieth chapter, the sages have described the all pervading, omnipresent Supreme Being whose primary name is OM. Enumerating the basic code of conduct, they have advised everyone to desire to live for one hundred years for performing God's work and to live every moment of life as if it were the last. Keeping that indestructible God in your mind all the time, is the only way to attain salvation from the bondage of the cycle of life and death. While stating that God is very far from the ignorant and very close to the learned, they highlight the ills of ignoring the universal knowledge. While describing the importance of the virtuous cycle leading from ignorance to illumination, everyone is cautioned against the ego some may get after improper implementation of the knowledge acquired."
